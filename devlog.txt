- The API is pretty well defined now, maybe a few changes to make task outputs more flexible
- Create a task scheduler to remove the risk around forgetting `await`s
- Create a proper test framework (with coverage) then start testing in TDD fashion:
  - Add a `clear` function to reset all global state
  - Make sure the tests run in sequence, not in parallel
  - Create a fixture project
